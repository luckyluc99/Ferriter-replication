# Ferriter-replication

To replicate the findings of Ferriter et al. (2020) for the US bond and equity markets, begin by copying the Data folder into the Ferriter-replication directory. Then, execute the "main.py" script. This script performs all necessary data cleaning, processing, and analysis. The scripts "plot_mispricing.py" and "plot_correlation.py" generate the key figures presented in the original paper, saving them to the Output folder for direct comparison with the published results. These files plot the exhibits shown in the publication. The core of the replication involves running main.py after correctly placing the data, with supporting scripts providing the visual outputs.
